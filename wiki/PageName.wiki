#Introduction to SLR

= Introduction =

Stellar Locus Regression (SLR) is an algorithm that takes uncalibrated astronomical magnitudes of stars from any field and calibrates the colors, which are magnitude differences, without the traditional use of standard stars. SLR exploits the fact that the majority of stars in the sky have colors that occupy a well defined, nearly one-dimensional region in hyperdimensional color-color space. This is called the stellar locus. SLR regresses raw colors to a standard stellar locus, delivering best-fit calibration terms, which can be applied to the other point- and extended-sources in the catalog. SLR can be performed on as few as 7 stars and in fields of view down to 8 arcminutes. SLR can be performed in real time, during observation.
